Hello, my name is Aleksandr, I'm a Junior Frontend-Developer from Saint-Petersburg!

Here is my solution for practical test 'Adaptive layout'.

I used the following libraries in my application:

- React
- React Router
- React Cookie Consent
- Node SASS
- validator.js

All styles are written in SCSS by Node SASS.

If you click on the Logo, you will be taken to the Home page. If you click on the Active button, you will be taken to the Empty page. By pressing on the ENter button, you will be redirected to the Subscribe page. This is all written with React Router.

Modal window is created with React Cookie Consent.

The validator.js library is used to check e-mail.
